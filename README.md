# Weather_Data_Analyzer

The objective of this project is to develop a Weather Data Analyzer that processes historical weather data, identifies patterns, and provides graphical insights through visualizations. This project will help users understand temperature variations, humidity levels, and rainfall patterns while also incorporating predictive modelling to forecast future temperature trends using Machine Learning (Linear Regression).

This project is ideal for:

  1. Weather analysts
  2. Researchers
  3. Data science learners
  4. Students interested in data visualization and machine learning

What This Project Does:

1.  Loads historical weather data from weather.csv
2.   Cleans missing values and processes time-based features
3.    Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4.Generates 4 key visualizations in a 2x2 dashboard layout:

  1. Line Chart – Temperature Trends Over Years
  2. Bar Graph – Yearly Rainfall Distribution
  3. Scatter Plot – Humidity vs Temperature Correlation
  4. Regression Line – Predicted Temperature for Future Years
5. Builds and evaluates a Linear Regression model
6. Forecasts temperature for upcoming years and visualizes trend

Key Features:

1. Clean and structured data pipeline using Pandas
2. Beautiful and interactive graphs using Matplotlib
3. Predictive modeling using Scikit-learn
4. Intuitive and insightful dashboard (all graphs shown together)
5. Lightweight and beginner-friendly project
