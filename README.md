# Weather_Data_Analyzer

The objective of this project is to develop a Weather Data Analyzer that processes historical weather data, identifies patterns, and provides graphical insights through visualizations. This project will help users understand temperature variations, humidity levels, and rainfall patterns while also incorporating predictive modelling to forecast future temperature trends using Machine Learning (Linear Regression).
